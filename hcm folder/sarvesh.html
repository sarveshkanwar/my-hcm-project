    and transformation. We believe that by engaging our hearts, minds and bodies, theater has the power to heal and imagine collective pathways forward.</p>

    for the twenty-first century. Inspired by the model of a teaching hospital, the building will be a vibrant center for research, experiential pedagogy, and performance.

    perspectives and experiences that reflect the diversity of our country and world. We are dedicated to making a welcoming and accessible space for people of any identity, background, or ability.</p>

    devote time to implementing and sustaining these values:</p>

  <h2 class="b">HISTORY</h2>
  <p class="f">Our theatre is a newly built theatre it was the insight of our late GURU who had a dream for this yet he could not do so after his death we 4 friends built it right from scratch from start we experienced many many problems soemwere
    financial
    some were violating the norms of the society we once even gave up our GURU's dream but soon we brought ourselves in postion to act and finally in 2021 after 3 years of hardwork and sacrifice we achieved what we wanted our brutal determination and
    hardwork paid off soon after we won our first OLIVER AWARD since then we turned unstoppable no matter what we realised thatif youwant to achieve someting big youwant
    need to constantly keep on working on that task no matter what the circumstances are you need to keep on moving as this life is an endless loop which will keep on going forever at last we thanks our funders and our share holders who helped us
    raise a massive amount of
    $24,000 dollars along with thanks to our actors, directors ,our staff....The landmark, situated on nine acres on Ashoka road here, has been handed over to a private construction firm for promoting flats and houses. The promoters, respecting its
    glorious past, have decided to dismantle the exquisitely designed stone arch carrying the legendary name of `Modern Theatres Limited' and erect it a few metres away with a new name, `Sundar Garden' as per `vasthu sasthra'. Other worn-out
    buildings, including studio houses and sheds, that figured in many movies are also being brought down. The arch is the only remaining of the glorious past.

    T.R. Sundaram's grandson Suman Sundaram who is settled in Australia is currently looking to enter into the film making and follow his grandfather's route in making successful new technology advancement in the Theatre Industry.
